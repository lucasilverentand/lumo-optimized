# Resource Packs

Lumo Optimized comes with several resource packs pre-installed and enabled. This guide explains what's included and how to customize your resource pack setup.

## Included Resource Packs

These packs are included and enabled by default:

### Fresh Animations
**Complete mob animation overhaul.**

Fresh Animations transforms how mobs move and behave visually:

- Wolves wag their tails
- Cats stretch and yawn
- Villagers gesture while trading
- Zombies shamble realistically
- Skeletons have fluid bow animations
- Creepers pulse before exploding
- And much more...

<Aside type="tip">
Fresh Animations requires Entity Model Features (EMF) and Entity Texture Features (ETF), which are already included in the modpack.
</Aside>

### Fresh Moves
**Player animation improvements.**

Enhances your character's movements:

- Smoother walking and running
- Dynamic swimming animations
- Better climbing animations
- Improved jumping
- Animated eyes

### Better Leaves
**Lush, bushy leaves.**

Replaces the default leaf textures with rounder, bushier alternatives that make forests look more natural and full.

### Low On Fire
**See through flames.**

When you're on fire, the overlay is lowered so you can actually see what's happening. No more burning blindness!

## Compatibility Notes

### OptiFine Format Support

These mods enable OptiFine-style resource pack features:

| Feature | Mod | Status |
|---------|-----|--------|
| Connected Textures | Continuity | Full support |
| Custom Entity Models | EMF | Full support |
| Custom Entity Textures | ETF | Full support |
| Custom GUIs | OptiGUI | Full support |
| Animated Textures | Animatica | Full support |
| Custom Sky | Puzzle | Partial support |
| Emissive Textures | Continuity/ETF | Full support |

### Pack Conflicts

If packs conflict:
- Higher priority pack (top of list) wins
- Check which features each pack changes
- Try different ordering

### Performance Impact

- **Resolution**: Higher resolution = more VRAM needed
- **Animations**: More custom animations = slightly more CPU
- **Connected Textures**: Complex patterns = minor performance impact

## Troubleshooting

### Pack Not Appearing
- Ensure it's a `.zip` file
- Check if it's for the correct Minecraft version
- Restart the game

### Textures Not Loading
- Check pack compatibility
- Ensure required mods are present
- Try disabling conflicting packs

### Missing Features
- Some OptiFine features may not be fully supported
- Check mod compatibility list above
- Update Continuity/EMF/ETF to latest versions

### Performance Issues
- Try lower resolution packs (16x or 32x)
- Disable animation-heavy packs
- Check RAM allocation
