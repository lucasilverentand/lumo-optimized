# Shaders

Lumo Optimized includes Iris Shaders with Photon Shaders pre-installed. Photon is specifically chosen for its excellent compatibility with Voxy LODs. This guide covers how to enable, configure, and optimize shaders for your system.

## Enabling Shaders

<Steps>
  1. Open **Options** → **Video Settings** 2. Click **Shader Packs** 3. Select
  **Photon Shaders** from the list 4. Click **Apply** 5. Wait for shaders to
  compile (first time only)
</Steps>

<Aside>
  Shader compilation can take 1-5 minutes on first use. This happens once per
  shader pack and is cached for future use.
</Aside>

## Photon Shaders

Photon is a gameplay-focused shader pack with semi-realistic visuals and excellent Voxy compatibility.

### Features

- Realistic shadows with beautiful lighting
- Volumetric lighting and fog
- Reflective water with caustics
- Waving grass, leaves, and crops
- Colored lighting (Iris exclusive)
- labPBR support for resource packs
- **Full Voxy LOD compatibility**

### Why Photon?

Photon Shaders is specifically chosen for its seamless compatibility with Voxy. Unlike other shaders that can have visual glitches with LOD mods (floating chunks, broken lighting), Photon works perfectly with Voxy for a consistent visual experience across all render distances.

### Performance

Photon is designed to be gameplay-focused, meaning it prioritizes smooth performance over extreme visual fidelity. Most mid-range systems can run Photon comfortably.

| GPU Tier                               | Expected FPS |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------ |
| Integrated (Intel UHD, AMD Vega)       | 20-40 FPS    |
| Entry-Level (GTX 1050, RX 560)         | 40-60 FPS    |
| Mid-Range (GTX 1060-1080, RX 580-5700) | 60-100 FPS   |
| High-End (RTX 3060+, RX 6700+)         | 100+ FPS     |

<Aside type="tip">
  Photon is more performance-friendly than many popular shaders while still
  looking great!
</Aside>

## Shader Settings

Access shader settings: **Shader Packs** → **Shader Pack Settings**

### Key Settings

| Setting         | Performance Impact | Recommendation                   |
| --------------- | ------------------ | -------------------------------- |
| Shadow Quality  | High               | Lower for better FPS             |
| Shadow Distance | Medium             | 2-4 chunks is usually enough     |
| Volumetric Fog  | Medium             | Disable if struggling            |
| Reflections     | Medium             | Lower or disable for performance |

### Recommended Settings by GPU Tier

**Integrated Graphics (Intel UHD, AMD Vega):**

- Consider playing without shaders
- If using shaders, minimize shadow distance
- Disable volumetric effects

**Entry-Level (GTX 1050, RX 560):**

- Shadow Distance: 2 chunks
- Lower render distance to 8-10

**Mid-Range (GTX 1060-1080, RX 580-5700):**

- Default settings should work well
- Shadow Distance: 3-4 chunks
- Render distance: 12-16

**High-End (RTX 3060+, RX 6700+):**

- Full features enabled
- Higher render distances possible

## Voxy Compatibility

One of the main reasons Lumo Optimized uses Photon is its excellent Voxy compatibility:

- LOD terrain is properly shaded
- No floating chunk glitches
- Consistent lighting across all distances
- Smooth transitions between LOD levels

<Aside type="tip">
  With Photon + Voxy, you can see hundreds of chunks away with shaders enabled
  and no visual artifacts!
</Aside>

## Adding More Shaders

You can add additional shader packs, but note that most shaders have issues with Voxy:

<Steps>
  1. Download a shader pack (`.zip` file) from
  [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/shaders) 2. Open **Shader Packs** screen 3.
  Click **Open Shader Pack Folder** 4. Copy the `.zip` file into the folder 5.
  Return to game and select the new shader
</Steps>

### Shader Compatibility with Voxy

| Shader              | Voxy Compatibility     |
| ------------------- | ---------------------- |
| **Photon**          | Excellent (included)   |
| Complementary       | Poor (visual glitches) |
| BSL                 | Poor (floating chunks) |
| Sildur's            | Poor (lighting issues) |
| Super Duper Vanilla | Untested               |

<Aside type="caution">
  If you use a shader other than Photon, you may experience visual glitches with
  Voxy LODs. Disable shaders or switch back to Photon if you encounter issues.
</Aside>

## Troubleshooting

### Shaders Won't Enable

- Update your GPU drivers
- Ensure you have enough VRAM
- Try restarting the game

### Low FPS with Shaders

- Lower shadow quality and distance first
- Disable volumetric effects
- Reduce render distance
- Voxy LODs have minimal impact; focus on shader settings

### Visual Glitches

- Ensure you're using Photon for Voxy compatibility
- Update GPU drivers
- Check for shader pack updates
- Ensure Iris is up to date

### Black Screen

- Wait for shader compilation
- Try pressing F3+R to reload shaders
- Disable shaders and try again
