# Shaders

Lumo Optimized includes Iris Shaders with Complementary Unbound pre-installed. This guide covers how to enable, configure, and optimize shaders for your system.

## Enabling Shaders

<Steps>
1. Open **Options** → **Video Settings**
2. Click **Shader Packs**
3. Select **Complementary Unbound** from the list
4. Click **Apply**
5. Wait for shaders to compile (first time only)
</Steps>

<Aside>
Shader compilation can take 1-5 minutes on first use. This happens once per shader pack and is cached for future use.
</Aside>

## Complementary Unbound

The included shader pack offers stunning visuals with good performance.

### Features
- Realistic shadows with multiple quality levels
- Volumetric lighting and fog
- Reflective water with caustics
- Waving grass, leaves, and crops
- Bloom and lens effects
- Customizable color grading
- Night vision compatibility

### Performance Presets

Access presets: Shader Packs → Shader Pack Settings

| Preset | Target FPS | Best For |
|--------|-----------|----------|
| Potato | 60+ FPS | Integrated graphics, older PCs |
| Low | 50-60 FPS | Entry-level dedicated GPUs |
| Medium | 40-60 FPS | Mid-range GPUs (GTX 1060, RX 580) |
| High | 30-50 FPS | High-end GPUs (RTX 3060, RX 6700) |
| Ultra | 20-40 FPS | Enthusiast GPUs (RTX 4070+) |

<Aside type="tip">
Start with Medium and adjust based on your performance. You can always fine-tune individual settings later.
</Aside>

## Performance Optimization

### Quick Wins

These settings have the biggest performance impact:

| Setting | Performance Impact | Recommendation |
|---------|-------------------|----------------|
| Shadow Quality | Very High | Lower for better FPS |
| Shadow Distance | High | 2-4 chunks for balance |
| Volumetric Fog | High | Disable if struggling |
| Reflection Quality | Medium | Lower or disable |
| SSAO | Medium | Disable for low-end |

### Recommended Settings by GPU Tier

**Integrated Graphics (Intel UHD, AMD Vega):**
- Use Potato preset
- Shadow Distance: 1-2 chunks
- Disable volumetric effects
- Consider playing without shaders

**Entry-Level (GTX 1050, RX 560):**
- Use Low preset
- Shadow Distance: 2 chunks
- Lower render distance to 8-10

**Mid-Range (GTX 1060-1080, RX 580-5700):**
- Use Medium preset
- Shadow Distance: 3 chunks
- Render distance: 12-16

**High-End (RTX 3060+, RX 6700+):**
- Use High/Ultra preset
- Full features enabled
- Higher render distances possible

## Shader Settings Guide

### Shadows
- **Shadow Quality**: Resolution of shadows (higher = sharper but slower)
- **Shadow Distance**: How far shadows render
- **Colored Shadows**: Tinted light through glass (disable for performance)

### Lighting
- **Global Illumination**: Bounced light (expensive but beautiful)
- **Ambient Occlusion**: Soft shadows in corners
- **Volumetric Lighting**: God rays and light shafts

### Water
- **Reflections**: Mirror-like water surface
- **Caustics**: Light patterns underwater
- **Wave Height**: Intensity of water waves

### Effects
- **Bloom**: Glow around bright objects
- **Motion Blur**: Blur when moving (preference)
- **Depth of Field**: Background blur (can affect gameplay)

## Distant Horizons Compatibility

Shaders work with Distant Horizons LODs! The LOD terrain will be shaded, though with some limitations:

- LOD terrain may have simpler shading
- Shadows typically don't render on LODs
- Water reflections limited to nearby terrain

<Aside type="tip">
For the best look with Distant Horizons, set your regular render distance to at least 8 chunks so the transition between full terrain and LODs is less noticeable.
</Aside>

## Adding More Shaders

You can add additional shader packs:

<Steps>
1. Download a shader pack (`.zip` file) from [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/shaders) or elsewhere
2. Open **Shader Packs** screen
3. Click **Open Shader Pack Folder**
4. Copy the `.zip` file into the folder
5. Return to game and select the new shader
</Steps>

### Recommended Shaders

| Shader | Style | Performance |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| Complementary Reimagined | Similar to Unbound, different aesthetic | Medium |
| BSL Shaders | Popular, customizable | Medium |
| Sildur's Vibrant | Colorful, many options | Low-Medium |
| Super Duper Vanilla | Vanilla+ enhancement | Low |
| Rethinking Voxels | Path-traced, stunning | Very High |

## Troubleshooting

### Shaders Won't Enable
- Update your GPU drivers
- Ensure you have enough VRAM
- Try a lower-end shader pack first

### Low FPS with Shaders
- Lower shadow quality and distance first
- Disable volumetric effects
- Reduce render distance
- Try a lighter shader preset

### Visual Glitches
- Update GPU drivers
- Try disabling specific shader features
- Check for shader pack updates
- Ensure Iris is up to date

### Black Screen
- Wait for shader compilation
- Try pressing F3+R to reload shaders
- Disable shaders and try again
