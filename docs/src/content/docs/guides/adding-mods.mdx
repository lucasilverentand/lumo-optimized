### Updating the Modpack

When a new Lumo Optimized version releases:
1. Download the new `.mrpack`
2. Create a new instance
3. Copy your `saves` folder from old instance
4. Re-add any personal mods

<Aside type="tip">
Keep your personal mods noted somewhere so you can easily re-add them after updates!
</Aside>

## Troubleshooting

### Game Won't Launch After Adding Mod
1. Remove the new mod
2. Check compatibility requirements
3. Look for missing dependencies
4. Check for mod conflicts

### Crashes After Removing Mod

2. Clear the config folder for that mod
3. If world won't load, restore from backup

### Mod Not Working
1. Ensure it's enabled (not grayed out)

3. Verify correct Minecraft version
4. Look for required libraries

## Best Practices

1. **Add mods one at a time** - Easier to troubleshoot
2. **Test after each addition** - Launch game and verify
3. **Keep backups** - Before any changes
4. **Note your additions** - For future reference
5. **Check mod pages** - For known issues and conflicts
