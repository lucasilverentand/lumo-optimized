# Frequently Asked Questions

## General

### What is Lumo Optimized?

Lumo Optimized is a Fabric modpack that focuses on performance optimization, visual enhancements, and quality-of-life improvements without changing core Minecraft gameplay.

### What Minecraft versions are supported?

The modpack is built for **Minecraft 1.21.8** and is compatible with 1.21.3-1.21.8.

### Do I need OptiFine?

**No!** Lumo Optimized includes Sodium, Iris, and other mods that replace and exceed OptiFine's functionality. Using OptiFine will cause conflicts.

### Is this modpack free?

Yes, completely free. All included mods are open source or freely distributable.

### Can I use this on servers?

Yes! All mods are client-side, so you can join any vanilla or Fabric server. Some features (like voice chat) require server-side mods.

## Installation

### Which file do I download?

| Launcher                                 | Download               |
| ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Prism, Modrinth App, ATLauncher, MultiMC | `.mrpack` file         |
| CurseForge, GDLauncher                   | `-curseforge.zip` file |

### How much RAM do I need?

- **Minimum:** 4 GB allocated
- **Recommended:** 6 GB allocated
- **With shaders:** 8 GB allocated

### What Java version is required?

Java 21 or higher. Most launchers handle this automatically.

## Performance

### Why is my FPS low?

Common causes:

1. Shaders enabled (disable for major FPS boost)
2. Render distance too high (try 12 chunks)
3. Not enough RAM allocated
4. Outdated GPU drivers

See the [Performance Tuning Guide](/lumo-optimized/customization/performance-tuning/).

### First launch is very slow?

Normal! The first launch takes longer because:

- Textures are being cached
- Shaders are compiling
- Resource packs are loading

Subsequent launches will be much faster.

### How do I enable shaders?

Options → Video Settings → Shader Packs → Select Photon Shaders → Apply

## Features

### How do I zoom?

Hold **C** to zoom. You can configure this in Zoomify's settings.

### How do I open the map?

Press **M** for the full world map. The minimap is always visible in the corner.

### How do I sort my inventory?

Press **R** with your inventory open. You can also middle-click to lock slots.

### How do I use voice chat?

Press **V** (push-to-talk). Voice chat only works on servers with Simple Voice Chat installed.

### Why can't I see far terrain?

Voxy generates LODs as you explore. Walk around and the view distance will extend over time. You can also use `/voxy import world` to generate LODs from existing chunks.

## Customization

### Can I add more mods?

Yes! See the [Adding Mods Guide](/lumo-optimized/guides/adding-mods/). Be careful about compatibility.

### Can I remove mods I don't want?

Yes, you can disable or remove mods via your launcher. Some mods are dependencies for others.

### How do I change keybinds?

Options → Controls → Key Binds. Look for the mod's name to find its keybinds.

### Can I use my own shaders?

Yes! Download shader packs and add them to the shaderpacks folder via the Shader Packs menu.

### Can I use resource packs?

Yes! Add resource packs normally. The included packs use OptiFine features that are supported by Continuity, EMF, and ETF.

## Compatibility

### Does this work with OptiFine?

**No.** OptiFine conflicts with Sodium and Iris. Don't install it.

### Does this work with Forge mods?

No, this is a Fabric modpack. Only Fabric mods are compatible.

### Can I use this with other modpacks?

This is a standalone modpack. Merging modpacks is not recommended.

### Is this compatible with vanilla worlds?

Yes! Your vanilla worlds will work perfectly. You may see LOD generation from Voxy as you explore.

## Multiplayer

### Can I join vanilla servers?

Yes, all mods are client-side.

### Why doesn't voice chat work on some servers?

The server needs Simple Voice Chat installed. It's not a vanilla feature.

### Why do I get kicked for chat signature issues?

Some servers require signed chat. Adjust No Chat Reports settings:
Mods → No Chat Reports → Try different compatibility options.

### Can my friends without the modpack play with me?

Yes, on both vanilla and Fabric servers. They just won't have the mod features.

## Troubleshooting

### The game crashed!

1. Check the crash report in `.minecraft/crash-reports/`
2. Share it via [mclo.gs](https://mclo.gs)
3. Create a [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/lucasilverentand/lumo-optimized/issues)

See the [Troubleshooting Guide](/lumo-optimized/guides/troubleshooting/).

### Shaders show a black screen

Wait for compilation (1-5 minutes first time), or press F3+R to reload. If stuck, see troubleshooting guide.

### Some textures are missing

Ensure resource packs are enabled. Options → Resource Packs → Move packs to the right side.

### My settings keep resetting

Your settings should persist. If they don't, check that your instance folder has write permissions.

## Updates

### How do I update the modpack?

1. Download the new version
2. Create a new instance
3. Copy your `saves` folder
4. Re-add any personal mods

### Will my worlds break with updates?

Generally no. We maintain compatibility. Always backup worlds before updating.
