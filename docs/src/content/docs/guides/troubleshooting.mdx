Having issues? This guide covers common problems and their solutions.

## Game Won't Launch

### Java Issues

**Symptoms:** Game fails to start, Java errors

<Steps>
  1. Ensure Java 21 is installed 2. In Prism Launcher: Settings → Java →
  Auto-detect 3. Or manually select your Java 21 installation 4. Try launching
  again
</Steps>

**Get Java 21:** [Adoptium Temurin](https://adoptium.net/)

### Not Enough Memory

**Symptoms:** Crash on launch, "Out of Memory" error

<Steps>
  1. Edit instance → Settings → Java 2. Increase Maximum memory allocation 3.
  Recommended: 4-6 GB 4. Don't exceed 50% of your total RAM
</Steps>

### Missing Libraries

**Symptoms:** Error about missing files

<Steps>
  1. Right-click instance → Edit → Mods 2. Look for mods with warning icons 3.
  Try: Delete mods → Re-add from Modrinth/CurseForge 4. Or reinstall the entire
  modpack
</Steps>

## Performance Issues

### Low FPS

**Quick fixes:**

1. Lower render distance (8-12 chunks)
2. Disable shaders
3. Allocate more RAM (up to 6-8 GB)
4. Close other applications

**See:** [Performance Tuning Guide](/lumo-optimized/customization/performance-tuning/)

### Stuttering / Lag Spikes

**Causes and solutions:**

| Cause              | Solution                      |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------- |
| Garbage collection | Use recommended JVM arguments |
| Chunk loading      | Lower simulation distance     |
| Shader compilation | Wait for initial compile      |
| World generation   | Wait for chunks to generate   |

### Long Loading Times

- First launch is always slower (caching)
- Allocate RAM on SSD, not HDD
- Reduce mods if heavily modded
- Be patient with shader compilation

## Shader Problems

### Shaders Won't Enable

<Steps>
  1. Update GPU drivers 2. Check GPU supports OpenGL 4.6 3. Try a different
  shader pack 4. Disable Voxy temporarily
</Steps>

### Black Screen with Shaders

<Steps>
  1. Wait 1-2 minutes (compilation) 2. Press **F3+R** to reload shaders 3. Try
  pressing **Escape** 4. Force-quit and disable shaders via config
</Steps>

**To disable shaders without launching:**

1. Open `.minecraft/config/iris.properties`
2. Set `enableShaders=false`
3. Launch game
4. Re-enable after fixing issue

### Visual Glitches

- Update GPU drivers (most common fix)
- Try different shader preset
- Check for shader pack updates
- Report to shader pack developer

## Mod-Specific Issues

### Voxy

**LODs not generating:**

- They generate as you explore
- Try `/voxy import world` command
- Ensure enough RAM allocated

**LOD gaps or holes:**

- Normal during generation
- Revisit area to regenerate
- Check Voxy settings

### Voice Chat Not Working

<Aside type="caution">
  Voice chat requires the server to have Simple Voice Chat installed.
</Aside>

**On supported servers:**

1. Check microphone is connected
2. Verify mic is selected in mod settings
3. Test with **V** key (push-to-talk)
4. Check system volume mixer

### Xaero's Maps

**Waypoints not showing:**

- Press **U** to toggle waypoints
- Check waypoint visibility settings
- Ensure you're in the right dimension

**Map not updating:**

- Cave mode may be enabled
- Check map settings
- Try **Shift+M** to refresh

## Server Connection Issues

### Can't Connect to Server

| Issue            | Solution                       |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Version mismatch | Ensure server is 1.21.x        |
| Mods required    | Server may need specific mods  |
| Chat signatures  | Check No Chat Reports settings |
| Firewall         | Allow Java through firewall    |

### Kicked for "Invalid Signature"

This relates to chat signing:

1. Open Mods → No Chat Reports
2. Try different compatibility modes
3. Contact server admin

## Crashes

### Finding Crash Logs

**Location:**

- `.minecraft/crash-reports/` - Crash reports
- `.minecraft/logs/latest.log` - Latest log

**Sharing logs:** Use [mclo.gs](https://mclo.gs) to paste and share

### Reading Crash Reports

Look for:

1. The mod name in the stack trace
2. "Caused by:" sections
3. Memory errors (out of memory)
4. Missing class errors

### Common Crash Causes

| Error                | Cause              | Solution                 |
| -------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------------ |
| OutOfMemoryError     | Not enough RAM     | Allocate more            |
| NoClassDefFoundError | Missing dependency | Install required library |
| MixinApplyError      | Mod conflict       | Remove conflicting mod   |
| OpenGL Error         | GPU/driver issue   | Update drivers           |

## Resetting Configuration

### Reset Specific Mod Config

<Steps>
  1. Close Minecraft 2. Open `.minecraft/config/` 3. Delete the folder/file for
  that mod 4. Launch game (defaults will regenerate)
</Steps>

### Full Config Reset

<Steps>
  1. Back up your `saves` folder 2. Back up `screenshots` if desired 3. Delete
  the entire instance 4. Re-import the modpack 5. Restore `saves` folder
</Steps>
