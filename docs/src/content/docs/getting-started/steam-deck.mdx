## Performance Tips

### Battery Life

For longer battery life:

- Keep shaders disabled (default)
- Lower render distance to 8 chunks
- Enable Steam Deck's 40Hz mode in Quick Access menu
- Keep brightness at 50% or lower

### Better Graphics

If you want to enable shaders:

<Steps>
  1. Options → Video Settings → Shader Packs 2. Select **Photon Shaders** 3.
  Click **Shader Settings** 4. Choose **Potato** or **Low** preset 5. Click
  Apply
</Steps>

<Aside type="caution">
  Shaders will significantly reduce battery life (2-3 hours vs 4-5 hours).
</Aside>

### 40Hz Mode

Steam Deck can run at 40Hz, which is smoother than 30 FPS but more battery-efficient than 60:

<Steps>
  1. Press the **Quick Access** button (...) 2. Go to **Performance** tab 3. Set
  **Refresh Rate** to 40 4. Set **Frame Limit** to 40
</Steps>

Then in-game, change max FPS to 40 in Video Settings.

## Troubleshooting

### Game Won't Launch

1. Verify Java 21 is installed in Prism Launcher settings
2. Check memory allocation is at least 4 GB
3. Try launching from Desktop Mode first

### Controller Not Working

1. Ensure Controlify is enabled in Mods menu
2. Check Steam Input is set to Gamepad
3. Restart the game after changing settings

### Poor Performance

1. Lower render distance to 8 chunks
2. Disable shaders if enabled
3. Check Voxy render distance settings
4. Ensure no background apps are running

### Game Too Small/Large

1. Adjust GUI Scale in Video Settings
2. Recommended: GUI Scale 3 for Steam Deck
