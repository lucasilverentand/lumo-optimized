## Memory Allocation

For the best experience, allocate the right amount of RAM:

| Usage                               | Recommended RAM |
| ----------------------------------- | --------------- |
| Without shaders                     | 4-6 GB          |
| With shaders                        | 6-8 GB          |
| With shaders + high render distance | 8-10 GB         |

### How to Change RAM in Prism Launcher

  1. Right-click your instance → **Edit** 2. Go to **Settings** → **Java** 3.
  Check **Memory** 4. Set **Maximum memory allocation** to your desired amount
  5. Click **Close**

<Aside type="caution">
  Don't allocate more than 50% of your total system RAM, and leave at least 4GB
  for your OS and other applications.
</Aside>

## Java Requirements

Lumo Optimized requires **Java 21** or higher. Most launchers will handle this automatically, but if you need to install Java manually:

- [Adoptium Temurin 21](https://adoptium.net/) (Recommended)
- [Oracle Java 21](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/)
- [GraalVM 21](https://www.graalvm.org/) (For potential performance gains)

## Next Steps

Once installed, head to [First Launch](/lumo-optimized/getting-started/first-launch/) to learn about initial setup and configuration.
