Congratulations on installing Lumo Optimized! Here's what to expect when you first launch the game.

## Initial Loading

<Aside>
  The first launch takes longer than usual as Minecraft caches textures and
  resources. Subsequent launches will be much faster!
</Aside>

### What Happens During First Launch

1. **Mod Loading** - All mods are initialized
2. **Resource Pack Processing** - Fresh Animations, Better Leaves, and other packs are loaded
3. **Shader Compilation** - If using shaders, they need to compile for your GPU
4. **Voxy Setup** - LOD system initializes

This process typically takes 1-3 minutes depending on your system.

## Pre-Configured Settings

Lumo Optimized comes with optimized default settings via YOSBR:

### Enabled by Default

- Fresh Animations resource pack
- Fresh Moves player animations
- Better Leaves textures
- Low On Fire overlay
- Continuity connected textures

### Video Settings

The default video settings are balanced for performance and quality. You can adjust these in:

- **Options** → **Video Settings** (Sodium)
- **Options** → **Video Settings** → **Shader Packs** (Iris)

## Enabling Shaders

Lumo Optimized includes **Photon Shaders**, but they're disabled by default for maximum compatibility. Photon is specifically chosen for its excellent Voxy LOD compatibility.

<Steps>
  1. Open **Options** → **Video Settings** → **Shader Packs** 2. Select **Photon
  Shaders** from the list 3. Click **Apply** 4. Wait for shaders to compile
  (first time only)
</Steps>

<Aside type="tip">
  Shader compilation can take 1-5 minutes on first use. This only happens once
  per shader pack.
</Aside>

## Testing Performance

### Check Your FPS

Press **F3** to open the debug screen and see your FPS in the top-left corner.

### Expected Performance

| Setup                    | Expected FPS |
| ------------------------ | ------------ |
| No shaders, 12 chunks    | 200+ FPS     |
| No shaders, 32 chunks    | 100+ FPS     |
| With shaders, 12 chunks  | 60-120 FPS   |
| With shaders + Voxy LODs | 50-100 FPS   |

_Results vary based on hardware_

### If Performance is Low

1. **Reduce render distance** - Start with 12 chunks
2. **Disable shaders** - They have the biggest impact
3. **Check RAM allocation** - Ensure 4GB+ is allocated
4. **Update GPU drivers** - Critical for Sodium and Iris

  gradually extend over time!

## Joining Servers

Lumo Optimized is fully server-compatible! All mods are client-side, so you can join any vanilla or Fabric server.

### Voice Chat on Servers

Simple Voice Chat requires the server to have the mod installed. On vanilla servers, voice chat won't be available.
