### Performance First
Every mod is chosen with performance in mind. We use industry-standard optimization mods like Sodium, Lithium, and FerriteCore to maximize your FPS.

### Visual Excellence
Beautiful graphics shouldn't cost performance. With Iris Shaders and Distant Horizons, you can enjoy stunning visuals while maintaining smooth gameplay.

### Vanilla-Plus Experience
We enhance Minecraft without changing what makes it great. No game-changing mods, just improvements to how you play.

Small conveniences make a big difference. Minimaps, inventory sorting, better tooltips, and more make your experience smoother.
