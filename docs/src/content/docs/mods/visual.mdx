### Low On Fire

Lowers the fire overlay when you're burning, so you can actually see what's happening.

### Why Photon?

Photon Shaders is specifically chosen for its excellent compatibility with Voxy LODs. Unlike other shaders that can have visual glitches with LOD mods, Photon works seamlessly with Voxy for a consistent visual experience across all render distances.
