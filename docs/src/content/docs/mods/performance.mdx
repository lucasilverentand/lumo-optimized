# Performance Mods

Lumo Optimized includes the most effective performance mods available for Fabric. These mods work together to dramatically improve FPS, reduce memory usage, and speed up loading times.

## Core Optimization

### Sodium

**The foundation of Minecraft performance optimization.**

Sodium completely rewrites Minecraft's rendering engine, providing massive FPS improvements on most hardware. It's the most impactful performance mod you can install.

**Benefits:**

- 3-5x FPS improvement on average
- Better chunk loading
- More efficient memory usage
- Reduced CPU overhead

**Settings:** Options → Video Settings

  Sodium replaces OptiFine's rendering. You don't need (and shouldn't use)
  OptiFine with this modpack.
</Aside>

### Lithium

**Game logic and server optimization.**

Lithium optimizes many game systems including mob AI, world generation, physics calculations, and more. Unlike Sodium, Lithium works invisibly in the background.

**Benefits:**

- Faster world generation
- Reduced tick times
- Better mob performance
- Lower CPU usage

**Settings:** No configuration needed - it just works!

### FerriteCore

**Memory usage optimization.**

FerriteCore reduces Minecraft's memory footprint, allowing more RAM for other things like higher render distances or more mods.

**Benefits:**

- 40-50% reduction in memory usage
- Fewer out-of-memory crashes
- Better performance with many mods
- Allows more RAM for other uses

**Settings:** No configuration needed.

## Rendering Optimization

### ImmediatelyFast

**Immediate mode rendering optimization.**

Optimizes various rendering systems that Sodium doesn't cover, like HUDs, text rendering, and map rendering.

**Benefits:**

- Faster text rendering
- Smoother HUD updates
- Better map performance
- Reduced frame time spikes

### Entity Culling

**Skip rendering entities you can't see.**

Entity Culling prevents Minecraft from rendering entities that are hidden behind blocks, saving significant GPU resources in crowded areas.

**Benefits:**

- Major FPS boost in villages and farms
- Reduced GPU load
- Smoother gameplay near many mobs
- Works with all entities

<Aside>
  Entity Culling is especially effective in mob farms, villager trading halls,
  and anywhere with many entities.

### More Culling

**Additional culling optimizations.**

Extends culling to more game elements like block entities, particles, and other rendering that Entity Culling doesn't cover.

**Benefits:**

- Culls item frames and paintings
- Optimizes particle rendering
- Reduces unnecessary draw calls
- Complements Entity Culling

## Background Optimization

### Dynamic FPS

**Reduce resource usage when not playing.**

When Minecraft is in the background or paused, Dynamic FPS dramatically reduces the frame rate to save power and system resources.

**Benefits:**

- Near-zero GPU usage when alt-tabbed
- Lower power consumption
- Reduces system heat
- Better laptop battery life

**Settings:** Mods → Dynamic FPS

| Setting              | Recommended     |
| -------------------- | --------------- |
| Unfocused FPS        | 1-5 FPS         |
| Hidden FPS           | 0 FPS           |
| Pause when unfocused | Your preference |

## Performance Tips

### For Maximum FPS

1. Keep shaders disabled
2. Set render distance to 12-16 chunks
3. Disable fancy graphics
4. Use fast clouds or disable them
5. Lower entity distance

### For Balanced Performance

1. Use shader performance presets
2. Set render distance to 16-24 chunks
3. Enable Voxy for far views (highly efficient)
4. Keep default quality settings

### Monitoring Performance

Use **spark** (included) to profile your game:

```
/spark profiler start
/spark profiler stop
```

Press **F3** to see real-time FPS and performance metrics.
