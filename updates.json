Thanks `NuruddinPlays` for making PR!\n- Small fixes.\n\n1.10.25:\n\n- Fixed OutOfMemory errors in crash assistant process introduced in previous update due to\n  hashing computing read entire mods files into memory.\n    - Now it uses a memory-efficient streaming approach to calculate hashes, ensuring constant memory usage\n      regardless of file size.\n\n1.10.24:\n\n- Redesigned \"Mod List Difference\" feature. Transformed from a simple text list into a fully interactive tool.\n    - **Interactive Tables**: Now displays changes in organized sections (Added, Updated, Removed).\n    - **Platform Integration**: Added CurseForge and Modrinth support.\n        - Identifies local files using hashing.\n        - Displays clickable icons linking directly to mod project pages.\n    - **New Actions**:\n        - **Revert Update**: Automatically downloads and restores the specific version defined in the modpack / latest\n          successful launch.\n        - **Restore**: Downloads and restores missing mods.\n        - **Manage**: Buttons to Disable, Enable, Remove, or Show mods in Explorer.\n    - **Smart Downloads**:\n        - Supports automatic downloading via API.\n        - **Manual Download Fallback**: If a mod prevents third-party downloads, a new dialog appears supporting\n          **Drag & Drop** (download in browser -> drop in tool -> auto-install).\n    - Asynchronous operations for hashing and network requests to prevent GUI freezing.\n    - Added localization for the new interface (en, de, es, it, pt, ru, zh).\n- Prevented workaround with spaces and calculating the width of the upload button automatically.\n- Fixed the mods folder location on lunar client.\n\n1.10.23:\n\n- Added option to skip split dialog (for large logs split into two parts) and automatically copy both links.\n- Added \"Simple Mode\" feature that hides logs behind a button (disabled by default).\n- Small fixes related to the new `stderr_stream.log` and legacy versions.\n\n1.10.22:\n\n- Now Crash Assistant log has full analysis message displayed to the user formatted with Markdown. So now people in\n  support channels can just copy it from the crash assistant log and paste it into Discord in cases where users ignored\n  analysis messages. Previously, it was truncated with just the first line.\n- Fixed logs were not added to the list of logs on Lunar Client\n  because they were located in different folders.\n- Fixed the text of the upload button in Brazillian Portuguese may be truncated.\n- Fixed, I forgot to add Brazillian Portuguese to localization list,\n  so localization added in the previous update didn't work.\n- Fixed `MedievalOriginsVsForgeOrigins` analysis not triggered some times.\n- Added some logging related to the new `stderr_stream.log`.\n- Fixed AnimatedBorder worked a little incorrectly with Windows display scaling(not 100%).\n- Marked versions 1.7.10 - 1.15.2 as release instead of beta,\n  as I have not seen issues for a long time on these versions.\n\n1.10.21:\n\n- Added Brazillian Portuguese localization. Thanks `paodelonga` for making PR.\n- Enhanced `LauncherLogger` to include millisecond precision in timestamps.\n- Now `stderr_stream.log` is displayed to the user only if it includes stack traces. Previously, it may include just a\n  couple of useless warning messages that make no sense.\n- Added new log analysis `JnaPermissionIssue`. Detects if JNA was not allowed to create temporary folder.\n- Added new log analysis `AzureLibAddons`. Detects if mods which depend on AzureLib need a different version of it.\n    - Suggests analysis to find incompatible mods or find all mods which require AzureLib.\n- Added new analysis GUI tool which will find mods that depend on AzureLib but require different versions of it.\n- Added new log analysis `MedievalOriginsVsForgeOrigins`. Notifies that Medieval Origins requires Fabric version of\n  Origins since some version instead of Forge version.\n- Added new log analysis `McdaMcdwVsClumps`. Notifies that MC Dungeons mods require Fabric version of Clumps on Forge.\n- Fixed detection of failure to create JNA temporary folder. Was working incorrectly when the error message was\n  localized to different languages.\n- Fixed JNA platform library path being located incorrectly on some MC versions (1.19.2, 1.18.2), which caused error\n  spam while locating terminated processes (win_event log). Also some other features worked incorrectly on these\n  versions.\n- Fixed `CorruptedModJar` analysis sometimes can be actually `CurseForgeCorrupted` issue.\n\n1.10.20:\n\n- Now Crash Assistant generates `stderr_stream.log` with stderr output of the Minecraft process. Some launchers are not\n  saving this info, while often only it contains the reason of the crash.\n- Added config option to disable `stderr_stream.log` generation.\n\n1.10.19:\n\n- Added support of a new format of MissingUnsupportedDependencies.\n- Fixed `ModuleFind` and `ModuleResolution` log analysis rarely cannot find the issue.\n- Fixed race condition during logs uploading.\n\n1.10.18:\n\n- New `CorruptedModJar` log analysis. Detects if a crash is caused by a corrupted mod archive.\n- Fixed `ServerConfigCorrupted` log analysis was not triggered sometimes.\n- Fixed `Create6Addons` log analysis was not triggered rarely.\n\n1.10.17:\n\n- Fixed a typo in the \"Too Many Changes\" warning text.\n\n1.10.16:\n\n- Now the modpack logo is displayed at the center, not on top. Added an option to return it to the top.\n    - If the modpack logo was square, anyway it consumed all available height, and this didn't matter.\n      This is applicable only for non-square logos.\n- Now config is restoring its canonical order for newly added keys.\n- Added a \"Too Many Changes\" warning for modpacks, disabled by default.\n  Allows configuring how many changes modpack creator allows\n  and displaying warning if the end user modified modpack, too heavily.\n- Fixed non-square but rectangle modpack logos were not sized correctly.\n- Fixed resize() function is working a little bit incorrectly when the modpack logo is configured.\n- Fixed the error in the log on Linux systems in an Intel corrupted processor checker.\n\n1.10.15:\n\n- Switch from PowerShell to native JNA-based Windows Event Log querying in `TerminatedProcessesFinder`. This was done\n  because PowerShell can start slowly on some rare systems.\n- Fixed invalid gui size hiding some logs initially (before resizing after a couple of seconds) if\n  `modpack_modlist.enabled` config option was disabled.\n\n1.10.14:\n\n- Added GIF support for modpack logos.\n- Added customization options for copied text of individual upload buttons.\n    - By default, a copied link now includes the log filename.\n- Fixed Intel microcode warning didn't display a microcode version correctly due to\n  differences in byte order on some systems.\n- Fixed the race condition during logs uploading added two versions ago.\n- Fixed `ConnectorIncompatibleFabricMods` log analysis added a couple of versions ago didn't work.\n- Many fixes and improvements.\n\n1.10.13:\n\n- Reword translatable strings. Thanks Miroma (`its-miroma`) for making PR.\n    - Improved formulations, style, consistency, clarity, and American-English grammar in many English strings.\n- Updated some strings in all languages to reflect recently changed behavior.\n- Fixed missing empty line at the end of language files.\n- Added new analysis tools:\n    - Corrupted Jar Finder\n    - Corrupted Config Finder\n\n1.10.12:\n\n- Added logo of mod.\n- Added icon for app.\n- Fixed one bug.\n- Preparation for theme support.\n\n1.10.11:\n\n- Added the config option to customize log order in available logs.\n- Added some padding for better looking.\n- Add a config option to include the modpack logo to the GUI.\n\n1.10.10.1:\n\n- Fixed changes in neoforge 1.21.10.\n\n1.10.10:\n\n- Fixed Auto-Fix for `GroovyModLoaderIPv6` may use incorrect java.\n- Fixed Auto-Fix for `GroovyModLoaderIPv6` didn't work for 1.19.x due to folder changes.\n- Fixed `GroovyModLoaderIPv6` issue detection on 1.19.x.\n\n1.10.9:\n\n- Added Auto-Fix for `GroovyModLoaderIPv6`. Now can fix the issue just by one click.\n- Improved `GroovyModLoaderIPv6` issue detection.\n- New `FerriteCoreNeighborTable` log analysis.\n- Refactored auto-fix button system to support multiple actions per crash reason. Updated `Create6Addons`,\n  `EpicFightAddons`, and `MixinApply` to use the new structure.\n- Fixed MixinApply was not detecting some cases.\n- Fixed `ModuleFind` log analysis detected not all mods containing package.\n- Fixed exceptions inside `matches()` of log analysis were not logged.\n\n1.10.8:\n\n- Implemented an optional Auto-Fix button inside the log analysis warning.\n    - Added buttons for Create6Addons, EpicFightAddons.\n- Added `ClassMetadataNotFoundException` analysis to `MixinApply` log analysis.\n    - Added auto fix option for it.\n- Fixed `MixinApply` was not detecting some cases.\n- New `GeckoLibOculusCompat` crash reason. Warns what on 1.20.1+ mod is no longer needed and causing crashes due to\n  GeckoLib by itself added compatibility with Oculus/Isis.\n- ModListDiff:\n    - Show jar name in case of version is same but jar name changed for ModListDiff.\n    - Fixed 2 mods were different if different was only case of the different chars.\n\n1.10.7:\n\n- 1.21.10 support.\n- Backported to:\n    - forge: 1.9.4, 1.10.2, 1.11.2, 1.13.2, 1.14.4, 1.15, 1.15.1, 1.15.2\n    - fabric: 1.14.4, 1.15.2\n- Fixed `oops` appearing in generated messages.\n- Small fixes.\n\n1.10.6.2:\n\n- Moved launch of our process on Neo 1.21.9 earlier.\n\n1.10.6.1:\n\n- Fixed internal api changes in Neo 1.21.9.\n\n1.10.6:\n\n- Added config option to prevent individual upload buttons delay after a crash.\n- `Open config file` in the `File` menu was moved from top to the bottom. (Thanks `Madis0` for making PR)\n- LanguageProvider redesign:\n    - **New Configuration Options:**\n        - Added `general.priority_lang_for_overrides` - Allows specifying a fallback language for overrides before\n          falling back to JAR language\n        - Added `general.generate_localization_overrides_folder_with_readme` - Option to disable creating the\n          localization overrides folder and README.md\n    - **Language File Processing Improvements:**\n        - Override files now only contain translations that differ from JAR defaults\n        - Automatic cleanup of redundant entries:\n            - Removes keys that don't exist in en_us (base language)\n            - Removes entries marked with `$DEFAULT` (generated by the old version of mod)\n            - Removes entries that match JAR values exactly\n        - Empty override files are automatically deleted\n        - Override files are rewritten to remove redundant entries\n    - **Language Loading Logic:**\n        - Simplified language loading process:\n            1. Load from current language overrides\n            2. Load from priority language overrides (if configured)\n            3. Load from JAR language files\n        - No longer generates override files with `$DEFAULT` placeholders\n        - Cleaner override files containing only actual customizations\n- Revamped localization README with detailed contribution and customization guidelines. With LanguageProvider redesign\n  description.\n- Removed funny GIF from `Intel chip bug warning`, as it may have stolen attention from the actual text and some rare\n  users found it not funny.\n- Significantly improved text of `Intel chip bug warning` in all languages to be less confusing.\n- Fixed clicking the link inside the trusted domain warning will just reopen the trusted domain warning.\n- Small fixes and improvements.\n\n1.10.5:\n\n- Initial release for 1.8.9.\n- Switched mdk for 1.7.10 and 1.12.2 to make maintaining legacy versions easier.\n- Added `download.fo` to trusted domains.\n- Improved some English strings.

Made bigger and more noticeable by default.\n- Fixed one log uploading issue in the 1.17-1.18.1 branch.\n- Small fixes.\n\n1.10.3:\n\n- 1.21.9 support.\n- Added early GPU renderer detection so the Integrated GPU warning is shown even on very early crashes.\n- Added Swedish `WasClosedByWindows` crash reason pattern for Windows event analysis.\n\n1.10.2:\n\n- Reimplemented removed in the previous update PowerShell functionality by allowed by CF ways without PowerShell usage.\n\n1.10.1:\n\n- Added configuration options for enabling/disabling analysis tools.\n- Added configuration options for McLogs anti-IP-like version censoring.\n- Added `FilesRemover` dialog for managing file operations (delete, disable/enable, show in explorer) in GUI.\n- Integrated `FilesRemover` to all analysis tools for convenient management of detected mods.\n- Fixed `CreateDependencies` analysis didn't find one rare case.\n- Fixed couple of issues with new `Jdeps Dependencies Analysis`.\n- Now `Jdeps Dependencies Analysis` can also find by package.\n- Reverted PowerShell related logic from `1.10.0` update, since it can take some time to be approved on CurseForge.\n\n1.10.0 major update:\n\n- Fabric: Moved launch of our process from PreLaunchEntrypoint to a LanguageAdapter\n  to run from the first possible point.\n  Also fixes Crash Assistant not starting issue if crash happened in some MixinConfigPlugin(before PreLaunchEntrypoint).\n- Forge coremod: Returned launch of our process to a constructor (to the first possible point) instead of\n  `initialize()`. This was done earlier because some needed params were unavailable that early. But I've found a way to\n  parse them. So now I reverted that old change.\n- Added Auto-Fix option for the Integrated GPU warning. Now can fix the issue with just one click instead of following a\n  quite complex guide for inexperienced users.\n- Add clarification for desktop users regarding monitor cable and GPU connection in all translations.\n- `IntelChipBugWarning`: Added microcode version diagnostics and improved UI/wording.\n  Now notifies users if their current microcode version is affected or not.\n- Marked `i9-13950hx` and `i9-13980hx` as affected for `IntelChipBugWarning`, since we've seen crashes caused by them.\n- Replaced `gpu-detect-jni.dll` GPU detection with C# based detection to prevent including DLLs in mod.\n  We're shipping C# source code, which compiles at runtime using `.NET` features available in any Win 10+ system.\n- New log analysis:\n    - `LegacyTooManyIds` - Too many ids on 1.12.2 and below.\n    - `NeoForgeVersion1_20_1` - Notifies that Neo on 1.20.1 is abandoned and causing many crashes and switching to Forge\n      is an official recommendation from Neo on that version.\n    - `ConnectorIncompatibleFabricMods` - Detects if tried to run fabric mod with connector, but's it's incompatible and\n      won't work. Suggests native forge alternatives if they exist. Currently, Sodium, Iris, Lithium.\n- Added new launcherlogs support: ElyPrism, SKLauncher, LegacyLauncher, CrystalLauncher,\n  KLauncher, PollyMC, Feather, Lunar, Technic.\n- Fixed TLauncher usage was not detected on MacOS or Linux.\n- Added handling for missing or corrupted mixin configuration detection in `MixinApply` log analysis.\n- Redesigned GUI analysis, transformed `CreateDependencies` to be able to add new analysis easily and fast.\n- Fixed `CreateDependencies` wasn't localized and had many hardcoded strings.\n- Fixed `CreateDependencies` wasn't looking to jar in jar of mods causing super rare to not detect problematic mod.\n- Fixed `CreateDependencies` was working incorrectly for fabric.\n- New GUI analysis tools:\n    - `MCreator Mod Detector` - Detects MCreator mods. Was already in `modlist.txt`, but now as separate GUI tool.\n    - `Epic Fight mod addons compatibility` - Same as `Create mod addons compatibility` but for Epic Fight mods.\n    - `Package/Class Finder` - Helps to find from which mod a class or package came.\n    - `Jdeps Dependencies Analysis` - Helps to find which mod depends on a class. This is especially helpful if you see\n      NoClassDefFoundError or ClassNotFoundException in your logs and don’t know which mod requires that missing class.\n- Redesigned Analysis menu, now displays a short description.\n- Now suggesting to use `Epic Fight mod addons compatibility` in `EpicFightAddons` log analysis.\n- 1.12.2 and earlier: Improved `OutOfMemory` analysis recommendations. Now recommending available mods on that version.\n- 1.12.2: Added compat with `Improved Cleanroom Relauncher` and `Cleanroom relauncher unofficial`.

Thanks `MagentaCoding` for making PR.\n- Jvm.dll analysis: Added one more possible reason for this.\n- Fixed issue with non-ASCII paths causing Crash Assistant not to start. E.g., Cyrillic or Chinese symbols in the path.\n- Removed CrashAssistantAgent and refactored classpath handling to improve stability on non-ASCII paths.\n- `TerminatedProcessesFinder`: Fixed handling of non-standard datetime formats, which caused PS cmd to ignore\n  time filter and grab all available event errors instead of just those from the last 15 seconds.\n- Fixed hs_err log can be not added in some rare cases.\n- Fixed Jdeps analysis didn't checked version of java, caused analysis detected nothing in case usage of outdated jdk.\n- Fixed mod on Quilt mod-loader wasn't working since some version due to bad QuiltZipPath implementation in the loader.\n- Fixed mod not working on Lunar Client because Lunar was ignoring PreLaunchEntrypoint.\n- Fixed mod was identifying platform as fabric if was used fabric version of mod on forge with help of Connector.\n- Fixed `ResourceLocationException` analysis wasn't triggered in some rare cases.\n- Fixed ANSI color formatting was still applied in modlist diff, ignoring `generated_message.color_message` setting.\n- Small fixes, formatting cleanups, and internal improvements.\n- The mod was relicensed under `KostromDan’s Modded Minecraft License (Version 1.1.3)`. Unfortunately, the LGPL did not\n  protect my rights and interests as I expected (it should have covered this case, but CurseForge decided that\n  derivative code does not need to comply with LGPL terms and conditions and, moreover, does not need to give any\n  attribution to the original project, even allowing others to falsely claim it as their own code). It may be due to\n  some confusion and complexity of the situation, but it is what it is. I am now initiating a court case, which will\n  cost me a lot of money, and that fact is quite disappointing. I am also disappointed that I had to relicense, but I\n  don’t see another way. There is a lot of drama. If this drama ever ends, I will most likely revert the license back to\n  LGPL.\n\n1.9.15\n\n- Backported to 1.16.1, 1.16.2, 1.16.3, 1.16.4 (forge)\n- Backported to 1.17, 1.17.1, 1.18, 1.18.1, 1.19, 1.19.1 (forge+fabric)\n- Backported to 1.20.5 (neo)\n- Now Crash Assistant is available for all modloaders on every single version on 1.16.5 - 1.21.8 version range without\n  gaps.\n- Small fixes and improvements.\n\n1.9.14\n\n- Marked 1.21.8 as compatible.\n- 1.7.10: fixed jar name to standard format for Crash Assistant.\n- 1.7.10: fixed CPU name wasn't parsing propely and was always undefined.\n- 1.7.10: Changed from Cleanroom discord to Legacy Modding discord for 1.7.10, as Cleanroom is a pure 1.12.2 community.\n- 1.7.10, 1.12.2: Changed initialization logic to run only on the client side.\n- 1.7.10, 1.12.2: Improved `mcmod.info` parsing in `ModDataParser` should fix all parsing issues.\n- 1.7.10, 1.12.2: Fixed Crash Assistant can be rarely starting twice due to another mods issue.\n- 1.12.2: Fixed Crash Assistant commands not available without cheats.\n\n1.9.13\n\n- Initial release for 1.7.10.\n- 1.12.2: Fixed with Cleanroom Relauncher Crash Assistant can be started twice due to it named differently on\n  different versions.\n- 1.12.2: Fixed due to some mods, hooks from Crash Assistant weren't executed, caused not correct behavior of mod.\n- 1.12.2: Removed most coremods and moved to forge events to improve compatibility.\n\n1.9.12\n\n- Finally fixed `gpu-detect-jni.dll` issue.
